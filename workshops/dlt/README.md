### DLT
DLT stands for Data Load Tool ; it is an open source library that helps developpers to load data from various sources, using python scripts.
It differs from other solution because it does not need any backends, simply importing it in the python file is enough to start creating pipelines.

It allows developpers to build data pipelines much faster. By being a library, dlt gives the advantage to create custom pipelines at ease and more flexibility.
It cas be used as a complement to an orchestrator like Mage, because it is mainly a pipeline building tools.
